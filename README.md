RideShare is a cab and auto rickshaw sharing web app designed to connect commuters who are traveling in the same direction.
It allows flexible ride booking, transparent cost splitting, and promotes eco-friendly, community-based travel.
It also integrates Google Maps API for location tracking and the user only needs to pay for the distance he travelled.
